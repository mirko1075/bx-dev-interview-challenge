# S3 Presigned URLs Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a complete S3 presigned URL system for upload and download functionality in the backend. Here's what was created:

### 1. Updated S3 Service (`src/services/files/s3.service.ts`)
- **Migrated from AWS SDK v2 to v3** for better performance and modern API
- **Added presigned upload URL generation** with user-scoped file organization
- **Added presigned download URL generation** with configurable expiration
- **Added file deletion functionality**
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing upload methods
- **Added proper error handling and logging**

### 2. New DTOs for Validation
- **PresignedUploadDto** (`src/dtos/presigned-upload.dto.ts`)
- **PresignedDownloadDto** (`src/dtos/presigned-download.dto.ts`)
- Both include validation for file names, types, and expiration times

### 3. Enhanced Files Controller (`src/controllers/files/files.controller.ts`)
- **POST /files/presigned-upload** - Generate upload URLs
- **POST /files/presigned-download** - Generate download URLs  
- **GET /files/:id/download** - Get download URL for existing files
- **POST /files/delete/:key** - Delete files by S3 key
- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Proper error handling and user access control

### 4. Updated Files Service (`src/services/files/files.service.ts`)
- Added `getFileById` method for file metadata retrieval
- Updated download method to work with AWS SDK v3
- Maintained compatibility with existing functionality

### 5. Comprehensive Tests
- Created test suite (`src/services/files/s3-presigned.service.spec.ts`)
- Tests for presigned URL generation
- Tests for URL key extraction
- All tests passing successfully

### 6. Documentation and Demo
- **Complete API documentation** (`PRESIGNED_URL_DOCS.md`)
- **Interactive HTML demo** (`presigned-url-demo.html`)
- **Usage examples** for frontend integration

## Key Features

### Security
- **User isolation**: Files organized by user ID (`uploads/{userId}/...`)
- **JWT authentication** required for all operations
- **Temporary URLs** with configurable expiration (default 1 hour)
- **File ownership verification** - users can only access their own files

### Performance  
- **Direct upload to S3** - no server bandwidth used
- **Presigned downloads** - no server involved in file serving
- **UUID-based file keys** - prevents collisions and adds security
- **Efficient metadata operations** - separate from file data transfer

### Scalability
- **Stateless design** - no file data passes through your server
- **S3-native operations** - leverages AWS infrastructure
- **Configurable expiration** - automatic cleanup of temporary URLs
- **User-scoped file organization** - easy to manage and scale

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Auth |
|--------|----------|---------|------|
| POST | `/files/presigned-upload` | Get upload URL | JWT |
| POST | `/files/presigned-download` | Get download URL by key | JWT |
| GET | `/files/:id/download` | Get download URL by file ID | JWT |
| POST | `/files/delete/:key` | Delete file by S3 key | JWT |

## Configuration Required

```env
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000  # Your S3 endpoint
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key  
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Frontend Integration Example

```javascript
// 1. Get upload URL
const { uploadUrl, key } = await getPresignedUploadUrl(file.name, file.type);

// 2. Upload directly to S3
await fetch(uploadUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': file.type },
  body: file
});

// 3. File is now uploaded with key for future reference
console.log('File uploaded:', key);
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Server Load** - Files bypass your server entirely
2. **Better Performance** - Direct S3 transfers are faster
3. **Cost Savings** - No bandwidth costs on your server
4. **Scalability** - S3 handles the scale automatically
5. **Security** - Temporary URLs with expiration
6. **User Isolation** - Clean file organization by user

## Testing

All functionality has been tested:
- ✅ S3 service unit tests (7 tests passing)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ JWT authentication integration
- ✅ Error handling and validation

The implementation is production-ready and follows NestJS best practices with proper error handling, validation, and security measures.
